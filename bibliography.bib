  abstract = {The definition of all space systems starts with the establishment of its fundamental parameters: requirements to be fulfilled, overall system and satellite design, analysis and design of the critical elements, developmental approach, cost, and schedule. There are only a few texts covering early design of space systems and none of them has been specifically dedicated to it. Furthermore all existing space engineering books concentrate on analysis. None of them deal with space system synthesis – with the interrelations between all the elements of the space system. Introduction to Space Systems concentrates on understanding the interaction between all the forces, both technical and non-technical, which influence the definition of a space system. This book refers to the entire system: space and ground segments, mission objectives as well as to cost, risk, and mission success probabilities. Introduction to Space Systems is divided into two parts. The first part analyzes the process of space system design in an abstract way. The second part of the book focuses on concrete aspects of the space system design process. It concentrates on interactions between design decisions and uses past design examples to illustrate these interactions. The idea is for the reader to acquire a good insight in what is a good design by analyzing these past designs.},

  abstract = {The number of small- and nano-satellites being launched into orbit is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. In order to avoid the creation of space debris,spacecraft developers have to take action in order to reduce the severity of space debris. A widely used guideline is to ensure that no space system is left in the Low Earth Orbit environment for more than 25 years after the end of mission. Given this guideline, this thesis investigates 1U, 2U and 3U CubeSats in Low Earth Orbit using the General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) in order to determine the maximum allowable value of the semi-major axis so that the 25 year limit is met. This analysis results in orbital decay diagrams which can be used by CubeSat developers in order to evaluate different orbits early in the design phase. These findings are then applied to the AcubeSAT mission in order to perform an orbital analysis tailored to the mission. AcubeSAT is a 3U CubeSat that is currently being designed by students in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with the support of the Education Office of the European Space Agency, under the educational Fly Your Satellite! programme. The objective of AcubeSAT’s mission is to probe the expression of eukaryotic genes in the environment of Low Earth Orbit. AcubeSAT’s design calls for a very specific orientation to be achieved in order to downlink all images to the ground segment. This orientation is evaluated using the theory of spin-orbit coupling to determine if this orientation can be maintained in the event of a failure in the Attitude Determination \& Control Subsystem of the spacecraft. Based on the findings, an alternative design solution is also proposed.},

  abstract = {Under constrained budgets and rigid schedules, NASA and industry have greatly increased their utilization of small satellites to conduct low-cost planetary investigations. Recent failed small planetary science spacecraft such as Mars Polar Lander (MPL) and Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO), and impaired missions such as Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) have fueled the ongoing debate on whether NASA's “Faster, Better, Cheaper” (FBC) approach is working. Several noteworthy failures of earth-orbiting missions have occurred as well including Lewis and the Wide-field Infrared Experiment (WIRE). While recent studies have observed that FBC has resulted in lower costs and shorter development times, these benefits may have been achieved at the expense of lowering probability of success. One question remaining to be answered is when is a mission “too fast and too cheap” that it is prone to failure? This paper assesses NASA FBC missions in terms of a complexity index measured against development time and spacecraft cost. A comparison of relative failure rates of recent planetary and earth-orbiting missions are presented, and conclusions regarding dependence on system complexity are drawn.},

The design of Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) sub-systems is highly challenging, due to the complexity of the underlying system, the number of faults to be considered and their dynamics. Existing industrial practices for FDIR are often based on ad-hoc solutions, that are conceived and developed late in the design process, and do not consider the software- and system-level RAMS analyses data (e.g., FTA and FMEA). In this paper we propose the FAME process: a novel, model-based, integrated process for FDIR design, that addresses the shortcomings of existing practices. This process aims at enabling a consistent and timely FDIR conception, development, verification and validation. The process is supported by the FAME environment, a model-based toolset that encompasses a wide range of formal analyses, and supports the FDIR design by providing functionality to define mission and FDIR requirements, fault propagation modeling, and automated synthesis of FDIR models. The FAME process and environment have been developed within an ESA-funded study, and have been thoroughly evaluated by the industrial partners on a case study derived from the ExoMars project.},

It provides recommendations for a future CubeSat bus standard. The survey is based on a literature study and a questionnaire representing 60 launched CubeSats and 44 to be launched CubeSats. It is found that the bus interfaces are not the main driver for mission failures. However, it is concluded that the Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C) data bus, as implemented in a great majority of the CubeSats, caused some catastrophic satellite failures and a vast amount of bus lockups. The power distribution may lead to catastrophic failures if the power lines are not protected against overcurrent. A connector and wiring standard widely implemented in CubeSats is based on the PC/104 standard. Most participants find the 104 pin connector of this standard too large. For a future CubeSat bus interface standard, it is recommended to implement a reliable data bus, a power distribution with overcurrent protection and a wiring harness with smaller connectors compared with PC/104.},

  abstract = {Fault-tolerance analysis reveals possible system behavior under the influence of faults. Such analysis is essential for satellites where faults might be caused by space radiation and autonomous recovery is needed. In this paper we present a statistical simulation approach for fault-tolerance analysis of satellite On-Board Computers (OBCs) that are based on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Since the logic level of COTS electronics is unknown to satellite designers, a new higher-level fault-tolerance analysis is required. We propose such technique that relies on OBC modeling and fault modeling, based on the modeling principle of Single-Event Upsets (SEUs). For the first time we can compare the efficiency of fault-tolerance techniques implemented in software and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). In addition, our approach enables to analyze system fault-tolerance at early development stages. In a case study the approach is applied to an OBC with a Microsemi SmartFusion SoC, that executes a satellite attitude control algorithm. The gained statistical simulation results enabled 50\% reduction in the hardware overhead of the implemented memory scrubbing technique without loss in fault-tolerance. Our method revealed critical fault-tolerance drawbacks of the initial system design that could have lead to satellite mission failure.},

  abstract = {Since the advent of CubeSat spacecraft, universities and private entities have been successfully designing and launching satellites at a fraction of the traditional cost. These satellites still accommodate useful scientific payloads. Another recently established satellite format is the PocketQube (PQ)-one eighth the size of a CubeSat – with the aim of further reducing launching costs. However, this brings with it the challenge of working with substantially smaller power, mass and volume budgets. Accurate ionospheric modelling requires the use of electron density measurements at the topside of the ionosphere which could be obtained via distributed in-situ sensing. This makes a low cost PQ constellation ideal for this application. In order to assess the feasibility of the PQ format, a preliminary study was conducted about the design of a PQ technology demonstrator capable of carrying a scientific payload. In this paper, the design approaches are discussed, keeping in mind the design budget restrictions as well as the constraints imposed by the ionospheric sensor.}

  abstract = {In this study, a novel reliability-corrected cost model for estimating the development cost of highly agile small EO (Earth Observation) satellites is presented. In order to develop the cost model of highly agile small EO satellites, a database has been constructed consisting of 49 satellites carrying electro-optical payloads and having a launch mass between 100kg and 1,000kg that have either been developed or being developed within a time frame from 1991 to 2011. The cost model of top-down type was developed by analyzing the database statistically. The reliability-corrected CER (Cost Estimating Relationships) developed in this study implement multiple parameters-based complexity indexes. In addition, the Cost Correction Factor (CCF) and Low Cost Small Satellite (LCSS) adjustment factor were newly introduced as additional parameters for cost estimation. The reliability-corrected CERs for 26 EO satellites were used for verification of the cost model developed in this study. It was observed that there are approximately 7\% of absolute average errors in the reliability-corrected CER. It is concluded that this cost model can provide cost estimates with a higher accuracy, as compared to conventional cost models such as USCM and SSCM. Finally, this paper also describes the results of cost estimation obtained by applying the developed cost model to highly agile small electro-optical satellites having specific performance requirements.},

  abstract = {Byte stuffing is a process that transforms a sequence of data bytes that may contain 'illegal' or 'reserved' values into a potentially longer sequence that contains no occurrences of those values. The extra length is referred to in this paper as the overhead of the algorithm.To date, byte stuffing algorithms, such as those used by SLIP [RFC1055], PPP [RFC1662] and AX.25 [ARRL84], have been designed to incur low average overhead but have made little effort to minimize worst case overhead.Some increasingly popular network devices, however, care more about the worst case. For example, the transmission time for ISM-band packet radio transmitters is strictly limited by FCC regulation. To adhere to this regulation, the practice is to set the maximum packet size artificially low so that no packet, even after worst case overhead, can exceed the transmission time limit.This paper presents a new byte stuffing algorithm, called Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS), that tightly bounds the worst case overhead. It guarantees in the worst case to add no more than one byte in 254 to any packet. Furthermore, the algorithm is computationally cheap, and its average overhead is very competitive with that of existing algorithms.},

It is far below the annual institutional budgets but the pace gained momentum since 2006 and specially 2012. Between teenage crisis and age of reason, New space is now old: the first start-ups shall confirm their promises, while new players pop up and try to find their way. It shakes the legacy players but they demonstrate resilience and adaptation capacity. It is now the right time to take stock of the first lessons learnt. Start-ups disrupt the established industry? Instead of a simplistic shortcut, this paper reports an "organizational ecology" study. With a deliberate industrial viewpoint, its ambition is to help understanding complex evolutions in the space ecosystem. The first part of the paper introduces the current ecosystem, its actors, the key trends and the main types of activities. Through facts and figures on technology, investments and markets, the second part reviews how "new space" trends are preparing the advent of big space. The third part summarises lessons from other industries and typical disruption scenarios that could affect space activities. The drivers of New space are discussed in section four. The last part is a foresight exercise, discussing possible evolutions and impacts, threats and opportunities. The decisive role of institutional actors and the new space with more and more space-faring nations is also highlighted. TSomething big is happening in space. While it is too early to depict the new landscape, this study shows that the future picture will not be black and white but more colourful. The size and the age of the company are less important than agility, mindset, ability to manage risks and to cooperate. A big vision for the future, from entrepreneurs or from nations, is also needed.},

  abstract = {The avionics architecture of in-orbit infrastructure elements is driven by safety. Safety of the crew inside the Columbus Orbital Facility (COF) laboratory module, safety of the Space Station as a whole for the automated transfer vehicle (ATV) when performing a rendezvous manoeuvre. The design answers on safety requirements, methods and tools used for the development stem from a common concept. The paper first describes the COF Data Management System architecture, basically organised in two layers with a strict hierarchical relationship. The vital layer is in charge of COF initial activation, safety supervision and emergency modes management. The nominal layer is a distributed system, organised around a local area Ethernet network. Under normal conditions, it is in charge of its own fault management supported by management agents distributed in the system. Fault detection criteria are derived from an FMECA (failure mode, effect and criticality analysis) and also from a SEEA (software error effect analysis). Recovery actions are allocated to various decision levels in the hierarchy depending on their time criticality. In ATV, the same principles apply, but the implementation is adapted to the peculiarities of an automated vehicle. The nominal layer, because of the time constraints bearing upon any reconfiguration, implements fault masking (majority voting) instead of fault detection and recovery.The vital layer is allocated the very critical task of monitoring the spacecraft attitude and velocity, and performing if necessary a collision avoidance manoeuvre. An end-to-end comprehensive methodology is put in place to be able to demonstrate the compliance of the systems to technical, product assurance and safety requirements.},

In a multicellular architecture, a set of independent k-out-of-n systems mimic the cells of a biological organism. In order to be beneficial, a multicellular architecture must provide more reliability per unit of overhead than traditional forms of redundancy. The overheads include power consumption, volume and mass. This paper describes the derivation of an analytical model for predicting a multicellular system's lifetime. The performance of such architectures is compared against that of several common forms of redundancy and proven to be beneficial under certain circumstances. In addition, the problem of peripheral interfaces and cross-strapping is investigated using a purpose-developed, multicellular simulation environment. Finally, two case studies are presented based on a prototype cell implementation, which demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture.},

  abstract = {Lean satellite programs are programs in which the satellite development philosophy is driven by fast delivery and low cost. Though this concept offers the possibility to develop and fly risky missions without jeopardizing a space program, most of these satellites suffer infant mortality and fail to achieve their mission minimum success. Lean satellites with high infant mortality rate indicate that testing prior to launch is insufficient. In this study, the authors monitored failures occurring during the development of the lean satellite HORYU-IV to identify the evolution of the cumulative number of failures against cumulative testing time. Moreover, the sub-systems driving the failures depending on the different development phases were identified. The results showed that half to 2/3 of the failures are discovered during the early stage of testing. Moreover, when the mean time before failure was calculated, it appeared that for any development phase considered, a new failure appears on average every 20h of testing. Simulations were also performed and it showed that for an initial testing time of 50h, reliability after 1 month launch can be improved by nearly 6 times as compared to an initial testing time of 20h. Through this work, the authors aim at providing a qualitative reference for lean satellites developers to better help them manage resources to develop lean satellites following a fast delivery and low cost philosophy while ensuring sufficient reliability to achieve mission minimum success.},

  abstract = {Space radiation is a harsh environment affecting all electronic devices used on spacecraft, despite the presence of Earth’s protective magnetic field in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Although particles inducing total ionizing dose (TID) can be effectively shielded against in LEO, particles responsible for Single Event Effects (SEEs) remain an issue for the reliability of electronics. This is particularly of concern considering the increasing use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components, not designed for space applications. In the frame of this thesis, the SEE response of three commercial memory types are explored: SRAM, FRAM and NAND Flash. Based on SEE test results, the possible fault mechanisms induced by SEE particles on those devices are analysed. In order to study and compare the devices’ response with actual in-orbit measurements, the RES (Radiation Effect Study) science experiment was developed and is presented. The RES experiment will be the payload of the MTCube (Memory Test CubeSat) nanosatellite, which is being developed at the University of Montpellier as a joint project between the University Space Center (CSU Montpellier-Nîmes), as well as the LIRMM and IES laboratories. MTCube is financed by the European Space Agency (ESA).},

In fact, study on radiation effects on electronic devices, effective design techniques to reduce such impacts, as well as simulation tools and design aids, has spanned for many decades. As a result, there is vast literature on the subject scattered in many places and in various forms, which inadvertently makes it difficult for non-specialists, such as an electronic engineer, to obtain relevant information effectively. The objective of the current paper is to provide a high-level overview in an organized fashion to guide readers to right literature for more detailed study on a specific topic in this area. The paper consists of three logically connected parts: radiation effects on electronics; design techniques to minimize such effects; and modeling and simulation tools available. For each part, a brief introduction of key issues is described first followed by a list of key references.

  abstract = {The purpose of this report is to determine the failure rate of small-satellite missions launched between the years 2000 and 2016. This analysis considers the rates of both partial and total mission failure, as well as the failures attributable to failure of the launch vehicle. This study observed that between the years of 2000 to 2016, 41.3\% of all small satellites launched failed or partially failed. Of these small satellite missions, 24.2\% were total mission failures, another 11\% were partial mission failures, and 6.1\% were launch vehicle failures. The small satellite failure data reveals an increase in the failure rate as the yearly launch rate has increased. The period 2000 to 2008 averaged 15 launches per year, during which 28.6\% of the small satellite missions failed or partially failed. The period from 2009 to 2016 averaged 48 launches per year, during which 42.6\% of the small satellite missions failed or partially failed. The launch vehicle failure rate for both periods was the same at around 6.1\%. The implication is that for modern small satellite missions, almost one out of every two small satellite missions will result in either a total or a partial mission failure. Counting the partial mission successes as “successful missions” reduces the failure rate, but only to 38.2\% for the period 2009 to 2016.},

  abstract = {Space mission-related projects are demanding and risky undertakings because of their complexity and cost. Many missions have failed over the years due to anomalies in either the launch vehicle or the spacecraft. Projects of such magnitude with undetected flaws due to ineffective process controls run into unwarranted cost, schedule overruns and account for huge losses. Such failures continue to occur despite the studies on systems engineering process deficiencies and the best systems engineering practices in place. To understand the reasons behind such failures, this work analyses some of the major contributing factors behind majority of space mission technical failures. To achieve this objective, we analyzed the failure data of space missions that happened over the last decade. Based on that information, we analyzed the launch-related failure events from a design decision-making perspective by employing failure event chain-based framework. By analyzing the failure events with this framework, we identify some dominant cognitive biases that might have impacted the overall system performance leading to unintended catastrophes. The ability of any design team to achieve optimal performance is limited by communication and knowledge deficiencies between highly dissimilar subsystems. These inefficiencies work to bias each subsystem engineer to prioritize the utility provided by the subsystem they are responsible for. In order to understand how engineering design decisions are influenced by the presence of cognitive biases, the second part of this study establishes a mathematical framework for utility-based selection based on Cumulative Prospect Theory. This framework captures the effect of cognitive biases on selection of alternatives by a rational decision-maker.From the first study, overconfidence and anchoring biases are identified as the two dominant contributing factors that influenced the decisions behind majority of the failures. The theoretical models developed in the second study are employed to depict the influence of biased decision-making on utility-based selection of alternatives for an earth-orbiting satellite's power subsystem. Predictions from these models show a direct correlation between the decision-maker's biased preference structure and local change in utility curve depicting the (negative) influence of cognitive biases on decision-maker's choice(s).},

These standards are now mandatory for future ESA programs as well as for many programs currently under development. However, while these packet standards address the end-to-end transfer of telemetry and telecommand data between applications on the ground and Application Processes on-board, they leave open the internal structure or content of the packets. This paper presents the ESA Packet Utilization Standard (PUS) which addresses this very subject and, as such, serves to extend and complement the ESA packet standards. The goal of the PUS is to be applicable to future ESA missions in all application areas (Telecommunications, Science, Earth Resources, microgravity, etc.). The production of the PUS falls under the responsibility of the ESA Committee for Operations and EGSE Standards (COES).},

Masat-1 is a 1Unit CubeSat, developed using a systems engineering approach, off-the-shelf components and open-source software tools. It was our aim to use it as a test-bed platform and as an initial reference for Cubesat flight software development in Morocco. The command and data handling system chosen for Masat-1 is a system-on-module-embedded computer running freeRTOS. A real-time operating system was used in order to simplify the real-time onboard management. To ensure software design reliability, modularity, reusability and extensibility, our solution follows a layered service oriented architectural pattern, and it is based on a finite state machine in the application layer to execute the mission functionalities in a deterministic manner. Moreover, a client-server model was elected to ensure the inter-process communication and resources access while using uniform APIs to enhance cross-platform data exchange. A hierarchical fault tolerance architecture was also implemented after a systematic assessment of the Masat-1 mission risks using reliability block diagrams (RBDs) and functional failure mode, effect and criticality analysis (FMECA).},

  abstract = {Besides large-scale space missions, the spread of CubeSats for a variety of applications is increasingly requiring the development of systematic approaches for risk management. Being these applications are based on components with low TRL (Technology Readiness Level) or with limited performance data, it is required to define approaches which ensure a systematic perspective. This paper aims to present a reliability engineering approach based on FMECA (Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis) to manage CubeSat reliability data and prioritize criticalities early in the design phase. The approach firstly proposes an alpha-numeric coding system to support the identification and labeling of failure modes for typical CubeSats\&rsquo; items. Subsequently, each FMECA coefficient (i.e., Severity, Occurrence, Detectability) has been linked to the CubeSat\&rsquo;s structural properties, reducing subjectivity by means of techno-centric proxy indicators. The approach has been validated in the design phases of a 6-Units university CubeSat for the observation of M-Dwarf stars and binary systems.

The formalized method could be applied to design procedures for nano-satellites, as well as being expanded for research and development in a variety of space missions.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, the space industry produced large and sophisticated spacecraft handcrafted by large teams of engineers and budgets within the reach of only a few large government-backed institutions. However, over the last decade, the space industry experienced an increased interest towards smaller missions and recent advances in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology miniaturization spurred the development of small spacecraft missions based on the CubeSat standard. CubeSats were initially envisioned primarily as educational tools or low cost technology demonstration platforms that could be developed and launched within one or two years. Recently, however, more advanced CubeSat missions have been developed and proposed, indicating that CubeSats clearly started to transition from being solely educational and technology demonstration platforms to offer opportunities for low-cost real science missions with potential high value in terms of science return and commercial revenue. Despite the significant progress made in CubeSat research and development over the last decade, some fundamental questions still habitually arise about the CubeSat capabilities, limitations, and ultimately about their scientific and commercial value. The main objective of this review is to evaluate the state of the art CubeSat capabilities with a special focus on advanced scientific missions and a goal of assessing the potential of CubeSat platforms as capable spacecraft. A total of over 1200 launched and proposed missions have been analyzed from various sources including peer-reviewed journal publications, conference proceedings, mission webpages as well as other publicly available satellite databases and about 130 relatively high performance missions were downselected and categorized into six groups based on the primary mission objectives including “Earth Science and Spaceborne Applications”, “Deep Space Exploration”, “Heliophysics: Space Weather”, “Astrophysics”, “Spaceborne In Situ Laboratory”, and “Technology Demonstration” for in-detail analysis. Additionally, the evolution of CubeSat enabling technologies are surveyed for evaluating the current technology state of the art as well as identifying potential areas that will benefit the most from further technology developments for enabling high performance science missions based on CubeSat platforms.},

  abstract = {Secondary spacecraft are being put in orbit at the rate of hundreds per year, with each year smashing the record set by the previous. These “piggyback” missions (which reach orbit using the unused mass/volume in a launch vehicle) come from every source: universities, government labs, large contractors, startups and even art collectives (⁈⁈). There are Beepsats, journal-worthy science missions, operational sigint missions, radio Amateur missions, technology demonstrations and venture-capital-backed remote sensing missions. For today, secondary spacecraft are almost exclusively low-Earth-orbiting missions, though even that limitation is changing. Despite the breadth of mission sponsors, mission developers, mission types and orbital domains, our terminology is unchanged and contradictory: cubesat (or CubeSat), picosat, smallsat. More importantly, decisionmakers hear a phrase like “half of all CubeSats fail” and assume that there's something inherently flawed in the CubeSat concept - instead of recognizing that half of “all” CubeSats fail because hobbyists make up more than half of all CubeSats, and their ad hoc practices fail two-thirds of the time. In this paper, we propose two taxonomies for secondary spacecraft: the first, based on the type of mission developer (e.g., Hobbyist, Crafter, Industrialist) and the second based on the type of mission flown (e.g., constellation, experiment, short operational, long operational and extreme operational). We will contrast these taxonomies against the existing ones (such as NASA's Class A/B/C/etc). Finally, we will use these new taxonomies to parse our existing secondary spacecraft database to provide meaningful examinations of mission types, mission success rates and opportunities for further study.},

The advent of commercially available, high-volume, and hence low-cost microelectronics has enabled a different approach through miniaturization. This results in physically far smaller satellites that dramatically reduce timescales and costs and that are able to provide operational and commercially viable services.

Such platforms are being used for several space applications, such as education, Earth remote sensing, science, and defense. As of May 31st, 2018, 855 CubeSats had been launched. Remote sensing application is the main sector in which CubeSats are being used, corresponding to about 45\% of all applications. This fact indicates the commercial potential of such a platform. Fifty eight countries have already been involved with developing CubeSats. The most used CubeSat configuration is 3U (about 64\%), followed by 1U (18\%), while 6U platforms account for about 4\%. In this paper, we present an analysis of the current situation regarding CubeSats worldwide, through the use of a dataset built to encompass information about these satellites. The overall success rate of the CubeSat missions is increasing over time. Moreover, considering CubeSat missions as a Bernoulli experiment, and excluding launch failures, the current success rate was estimated, as a parameter of a binomial distribution, to be about 75\%. By using a logistic model and considering that the launchings keep following the current tendency, one can expect that one thousand CubeSats will be launched in 2021, within 95\% certainty.},

The FDIR challenges range from pre-design and design stages for upcoming and new programs, to improvement of the performance of in-service flying systems. For space missions, optimization of flight conditions and safe operation is intrinsically related to GNC (Guidance, Navigation \& Control) system of the spacecraft and includes sensors and actuators monitoring. Many future space missions will require autonomous proximity operations including fault diagnosis and the subsequent control and guidance recovery actions. For upcoming and future aircraft, one of the main issues is how early and robust diagnosis of some small and subtle faults could contribute to the overall optimization of aircraft design. This issue would be an important factor for anticipating the more and more stringent requirements which would come in force for future environmentally-friendlier programs. The paper underlines the reasons for a widening gap between the advanced scientific FDIR methods being developed by the academic community and technological solutions demanded by the aerospace industry.},
