	abstract = {{ARMs} and microcontrollers are low-cost, low-power microprocessors that are frequently used in embedded computing. While not immune to the naturally occurring radiation environment in space, these microprocessors can be worthwhile replacements for space-grade microprocessors for non-mission-critical computational tasks. In this paper results from radiation testing for several available {ARMs} and microcontrollers are presented.},
