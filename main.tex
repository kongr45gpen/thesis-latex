\chapter*{Abstract}

\justify
Space is not a welcoming environment; while the aerospace engineering community has managed to reliably operate thousands of satellites in orbit, CubeSats, the most popular class of nanosatellite, only have a 50\% success rate. Low costs, lack of strict technical requirements and scarcity of publicly available documentation often drive up the risks for educational, scientific and commercial CubeSats. This thesis investigates a configurable and modular Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) architecture that uses the ECSS Packet Utilisation Standard. This FDIR concept, along with the provided open-source software implementation, can be used by CubeSat missions to increase the reliability of their design and chances of mission success, by autonomously responding to on-board errors. The thesis also includes background information regarding CubeSat reliability, and explores the software and hardware used to implement the proposed FDIR design on the AcubeSAT mission, currently under design by students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

	\label{fig:satellite_types}
\end{marginfigure}

This thesis investigates Aerospace Engineering, focusing on satellite manufacturing and operation. The first artificial satellite \e{``Sputnik 1''} was launched in 1957, and by 2021 about \SI{8900}{} satellites have been launched, of which about \SI{4000}{} are currently operational and in orbit \autocite{unionofconcernedscientists_satellite_database_2021,kelso_norad_twoline,wood_visualizing_all_2020}.

Artificial satellites can perform a number of different functions, which typically include telecommunications, earth observation, navigation (\acs{GNSS}), scientific research, technology demonstration, and other purposes, excluding manned missions, missions beyond Earth orbit, and space stations. The data generated using space technology have long been an integral part of modern civilisation, having influenced transportation, weather forecasting, and technology.

\begin{figure}

				\label{fig:all_satellites}
				\setfloatalignment{t}
			\end{figure}
			
After launch, satellites typically remain in space until the completion of their mission after some years, at which point they can either return to Earth and burn up in the atmosphere, or remain in space as space junk.

\begin{marginfigure}
	\includegraphics{cool_satellite}

\end{marginfigure}

Space technology developments present a significant degree of difficulty, which stems from the highly increased reliability requirements in the harsh environment of space. In particular, the long distances, extreme temperatures, mechanical launch loads, high-energy radiation, vacuum, and the inability to repair damage, have raised a wide range of challenges in space exploration. As such, aerospace projects are integrally linked to a number of engineering disciplines such as systems engineering, product assurance, reliability engineering, and assembly, integration and verification. This thesis focuses on \textbf{\acf{FDIR}}, i.e. the ability of space systems to automatically detect and recover from faults and operational failures.%\acusepage{reliability}
	
Despite the above-mentioned difficulties, modern technology has advanced enough to make space a commercial target. As part of the ``NewSpace'' philosophy, more and more commercial or non-profit entities are taking advantage of the possibilities offered beyond the limits of our planet \autocite{denis_new_space_2020}. Start-ups, satellite constellations, educational missions and commercial services are concepts that have already become commonplace in the 21\textsuperscript{st} century, with more countries around the world obtaining access to space or even launch capabilities.

	\includegraphics{f1_cubesat_fm}
	\caption{The ``F-1'' CubeSat of the FPT University in Vietnam (1U size)}
	\label{fig:cubesat}
\end{marginfigure}

Given the above, this thesis is focused on the increasingly popular \textbf{nanosatellite} technology \autocite{sweeting_modern_small_2018a}. \textbf{CubeSats}, the most popular class of nanosatellite, were introduced as a concept in 1999. Their low cost and size, as well as their relatively low complexity, have allowed universities and organizations worldwide to launch over \SI{1530}{} CubeSats by 2021 \autocite{swartwout_cubesat_database_2021}.
	
CubeSats are designed using ``building blocks'' sized at \SI[product-units = single]{10 x 10 x 10}{\centi\metre} called \textbf{Units}. Typical satellite sizes are obtained by "stacking" these units, resulting in satellites of 1U, 1.5U, 2U, 3U, 6U and 12U. Each unit can weigh up to \SI{2}{\kilogram} \autocite{CDS14}. Internally,  CubeSats use low-cost commercial electronic components, henceforth referred to as \textbf{\acf{COTS}} components. CubeSats are typically launched in Low Earth Orbits (\acs{LEO}) \autocite{anthopoulos_orbital_analysis_2020,riebeek_catalog_earth_2009}, deployed as secondary payloads in larger satellite launches (``piggyback launches''), and remain active for periods of about 1 to 3 years.

This work is dedicated to improving the reliability of nanosatellites and CubeSat systems. Although the majority of large satellite launches have completed their missions, even partially \autocite{kattakuri_failures_spacecraft_2019,jacklin_smallsatellite_mission_2019}, 39.6\% of launched CubeSats have failed to complete their mission or did not operate at all. This number can be increased to 57.0\% if we focus on the subset of CubeSats launched as the first space mission of an organisation lacking the expertise of major manufaturers and space entities.

The reasons explaining the high failure rate of CubeSats are mainly related to the compressed manufacturing schedule, which leads to errors and problems that aren't detected during design. Sources of failures such as environmental degradation (thermal cycles, radiation), lack of safety margins in power and telecommunications, and software problems, combined with the general lack of experience and haphazard procedures followed by new manufacturers, reduce the overall reliability of nanosatellites \autocite{swartwout_cubesat_mission_2019,langer_reliability_estimation_2017}.

The approaches taken to increase CubeSat reliability include:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Reducing the number of potential failures from the design phase, by including reliability analysis in the early phases of a project
	\item Structured reliability assessment and improvement tools, such as \textbf{\acf{FMEA}} and \textbf{\acf{FDIR}} \autocite{faure_lean_satellites_2017,menchinelli_reliability_engineering_2018}
	\item Adaptation and adoption of open space standards for design, manufacturing and verification
\end{compactitem}


This work intends to supplement the toolbox of CubeSat manufacturers, by detailing a structured approach to \ac{FDIR} based on the \textbf{European \acs{ECSS} standards} and the work of the \textbf{\acs{SAVOIR}} initiative \footurl{https://savoir.estec.esa.int} of the European Space Industry. In the main matter, we will discuss how these ideas can be adapted to a low-scale CubeSat mission, presenting:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A structured method to investigate the possible failure modes of a satellite, and how they can be tackled
	\item Software that can respond to and safely manage all critical in-orbit failures
	\item A \textbf{configurable and modular} architecture that allows operators to easily modify the behaviour of the \acs{FDIR} system and tailor it for different environments.
\end{itemize}

The proposed \acs{FDIR} system aims to increase confidence during development, but also to quickly incorporate new information generated during testing, or even after launch.

In addition to the presentation, analysis and commentary on the standards, this thesis focuses on the application of the aforementioned \acs{FDIR} structure to the \emph{AcubeSAT} nanosatellite, and includes an experimental implementation of the \acs{FDIR} suite in hardware \& software.

\section{Thesis structure}

This document begins with a summary of the AcubeSAT mission, which is the main motivation behind it (\Cref{cap:acubesat}). It then proceeds to an analysis of the main \acs{FDIR} standards and philosophy, focusing on the parts of particular importance to CubeSats and educational missions (\Cref{cap:savoir}). The next section discusses the application of the previous standards to the design of AcubeSAT, and analyses some design decisions and implementation details of \acs{FDIR} on the nanosatellites (\Cref{cap:acufdir}).

The last chapter includes a practical demonstration of the proposed \acs{FDIR} on a simple two-sensor test system (\Cref{cap:practical}). The system is constructed so that it can detect and recover from all foreseen possible failures, using the libraries covering the \acs{ECSS} and \acs{FDIR} standards. After the system has been developed, a full test of its response to failures is performed. This simulation platform is configured to emulate the satellite system, including the microcontroller and the ground station.

\end{marginfigure}


The implementation framework of this work is the \textbf{``AcubeSAT''} nanosatellite project, which, as of 2021, is under development by students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and aims to perform biology-centred research in space.

The project was initiated in 2016. In February 2020, it became part of the \foothref{https://www.esa.int/Education/CubeSats_-_Fly_Your_Satellite}{``Fly Your Satellite!\ 3''} programme by the European Space Agency, aiming at a 2023 launch.

AcubeSAT is 3 CubeSat units large (3U), measuring \SI[product-units = single]{10 x 10 x 34.05}{\centi\metre} and weighing \SI{4.26}{\kilo\gram}. Physically, the CubeSat contains the \textbf{experimental payload}, covering the bottom 2U, and the rest of the \textbf{spacecraft platform} which takes up the remaining 1U.

The AcubeSAT project follows an \textbf{open-source philosophy}, making the software, developments and documentation available to the public under free licenses, at \url{https://gitlab.com/acubesat/}.

\section{The mission}

AcubeSAT's main mission is the study of \textbf{eukaryotic cells} in \acl{LEO}, and more specifically the assessment of the effects of \emph{radiation} and \emph{microgravity} on 190 different strains of the yeast species \emph{Saccharomyces Cerevisiae}. The previous are achieved with a novel lab-on-a-chip construction, structured around a \textbf{microfluidic chip} (\Cref{fig:microfluidic_chip}) \autocite{volpetti_microfluidic_biodisplay_2017} that allows the regulation of gene expression to be monitored on an unprecedented scale.

The results of the experiment are telemetered to Earth in the form of photographs, where the entirety of the microfluidic chip's chambers are depicted, and results are extracted acording to the \textbf{fluorescence level} produced in each chamber. The results in orbit are compared to a similar ground-based reference experiment.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{cubesat_exploded}
	\caption{View of AcubeSAT's interior, showing the different subsystems and the experimental setup}
\end{figure}

\section{Subsystems}

The AcubeSAT nanosatellite is technically and programmatically split into 11 different subteams or \textbf{subsystems}, each responsible for a different section of the satellite, and made up out of \SIrange{2}{9}{} dedicated members.

\begin{marginfigure}
	\includegraphics{microfluidic_chip}
	\caption{Microfluidic chip engineering model}
	\label{fig:microfluidic_chip}
\end{marginfigure}

In the following sections, a brief introduction on the function and design of each subsystem is presented. As the Systems Engineering and \acl{PA} process is inherently connected to the function of all subsystems, the details relevant to \acs{FDIR} are also mentioned. For more detailed information, the reader is encouraged to refer to \foothref{https://acubesat.spacedot.gr/subsystems/}{AcubeSAT's website}, or to the publicly available \foothref{https://gitlab.com/acubesat/documentation/cdr-public}{\ac{CDR} documents}.
\subsection{\acf{ADCS}}
\label{sec:adcs}

The \ac{ADCS} subteam is responsible for controlling the \textbf{attitude} and orientation of the spacecraft in orbit. This is achieved using a series of \ac{COTS} control actuators (one 3-axis magnetorquer board, one 1-axis reaction wheel), sensors for attitude determination (1 gyroscope and 2 magnetometers), and filtering, determination \& control algorithms \autocite{DDJF_AOCS}.

The \ac{ADCS} can operate under different pointing profiles for different attitude needs:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Detumbling}, where the satellite is attempting to minimize its angular acceleration close to 0, to ensure a stable communications link, prevent detachment of parts and allow easier regaining of pointing.
	
	\begin{marginfigure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{AcubeSAT_reference_frame_cropped.pdf}
		\caption{AcubeSAT reference frame}
		\label{fig:frame}
	\end{marginfigure}
	
	Detumbling mode is implemented in the simplest possible way, using only one of the 2 redundant magnetometers and a simple control algorithm. It is activated when there is no need to apply any of the specific pointing modes, or if the spacecraft angular rate is too high. In AcubeSAT, system-wide \emph{Safe Mode}, \emph{Commissioning Mode} and \emph{Science Mode} apply detumbling.
	
	\item \textbf{Nadir pointing}, where the satellite points the \(+X\) side towards the Earth. This profile is used during \emph{Nominal Mode} on passes over the \acl{GS}, where the directional patch antenna needs direct visibility.
	
	\item \textbf{Sun pointing}, where the satellite points two sides to the sun with a \SI{45}{\degree} angle of incident each, in order to maximise solar panel input. This profile is used during \emph{Nominal Mode}, between \ac{GS} passes, in order to ensure a positive power budget.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{margintable}
	\centering
	\caption[Maximum ADCS error values after stabilisation]{Maximum \ac{ADCS} error values after stabilisation}
	\label{tab:adcsape}
	\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
		\toprule
		Error                      & Value                    \\ \midrule
		Absolute Performance Error & \( < \SI{30}{\degree} \) \\
		Absolute Knowledge Error   & \( < \SI{1}{\degree} \) 
	\end{tabular}
\end{margintable}

The performance of the \ac{ADCS} system can be summarised using performance metrics such as the ones presented in \Cref{tab:adcsape}.

\subsection{\acf{COMMS}}

The communications subsystem is responsible for transmitting data between the Earth and the spacecraft in orbit. The transmitted data is split into 3 different categories \autocite{DDJF_TTC}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\acf{TC}}: Commands from the Earth to the satellite. They can be used to request information, or to perform specific spacecraft actions.
	\item \textbf{\acf{TM}}: Information sent from the satellite towards Earth, typically including vital information such as sensor values, system status, timestamps and events.
	\item \textbf{Science data}: The scientific data generated by the payload. These are the highest-volume data and represent the main scientific output of the mission.
\end{itemize}

It is important to mention that the satellite orbit only allows for a very short visibility duration every day, increasing the needs for on-board autonomy and the importance of a correctly implemented \acs{FDIR} method.

\begin{marginfigure}
	\includegraphics{satnogs-comms}
	\caption{The SatNOGS COMMS board}
\end{marginfigure}

The main component of the \acs{COMMS} subsystem is the \textbf{SatNOGS COMMS board} \autocite{surligas_satnogscomms_2021}, an open-source \acs{RF} transceiver developed by the \href{https://libre.space/}{LibreSpace Foundation}, based on \acs{CCSDS} telecommunications standards.

Communication will take place using 2 frequency bands on the \acs{ISM} range, namely \SI{436.5}{\mega\hertz} and \SI{2.425}{\giga\hertz}, supported by a deployable turnstile and a directional patch antenna respectively. The use of \acs{ISM} frequencies allows easy radio-amateur access to the satellite. The first (\acs{UHF}) band also emits a periodic \textbf{beacon}, listing information about satellite status.

The communications subsystem is also responsible for the \ac{EMC} analysis and interference mitigation, as well as the design and construction of the satellite \acl{GS}. The \acl{GS} will be part of \textbf{SatNOGS} \autocite{white_overview_satellite_2018}, a global network of satellite ground stations based on open technologies and open data.

\subsection{\acf{EPS}}
The \ac{EPS} is the subsystem responsible for the generation, distribution and storage of electrical power of the spacecraft. It is a critical aspect of the spacecraft due to the direct dependence of all subsystems to the high power needs of many CubeSat subsystems, and is theorised to be the most common reason for CubeSat failure \autocite{langer_reliability_cubesats_2016}.

\begin{margintable}
	\caption{AcubeSAT nominal mode power budget}
	\label{tab:power_budget}
	\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}lX@{}}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Consumer}            & \textbf{Power}            \\ \midrule
		\acs{ADCS}          & \SI{1.10}{\watt} \\
		\acs{COMMS}         & \SI{0.85}{\watt} \\
		\acs{EPS}           & \SI{0.99}{\watt} \\
		\acs{OBC}           & \SI{0.12}{\watt} \\
		\acs{SU}            & \SI{0.25}{\watt} \\ \midrule
		Total               & \SI{3.30}{\watt} \\
		Orbit Average Power & \SI{4.24}{\watt} \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
\end{margintable}

AcubeSAT has opted for a \ac{COTS} subsystem approach for the \ac{EPS} \autocite{DDJF_SYS}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Solar panels} are procured from EnduroSat. Four 3U panels cover the \(X\) and \(Y\) faces of the satellite, and one 1U panel covers the \(-Z\) face.
	\item The \textbf{\ac{PCDU}} is procured from NanoAvionics and offers 10 switched channels with overcurrent protection over 4 voltage rails, as well as 4 \ac{MPPT} converters.
	\item The \textbf{battery pack}, also procured from NanoAvionics, contains 4 18650 Li-Ion cells in a 2S2P\footnote{2 series, 2 parallel} configuration.
\end{itemize}



\FloatBarrier
A dynamic approach is taken with regards to power budget calculation:
\begin{compactenum}
	\item The in-orbit power generation is calculated for the duration of the mission using the \textbf{STK} software, taking into account satellite orientation, pointing profiles and eclipse, with a \SI{1}{\minute} resolution.
	\item The power consumption of the system is calculated on average for each different operational mode.
	\item \acs{MPPT} efficiencies and battery charge level are calculated for each timepoint, assuming worst-case thermal and electrical conditions
	\item A system-wide 10\% margin is applied to the results.
\end{compactenum}

We have created a Python library consolidating the above steps\footurl{https://gitlab.com/acubesat/eps/power-budget} and producing the necessary outputs to prove the adequacy of the design.

\subsection{\acf{OBDH}}
\label{sec:obdh}

The \ac{OBDH} subsystem is responsible for the design of the spacecraft's data interfaces, as well as the design of the \textbf{\acf{OBC}} board, tasked with controlling the basic spacecraft functions.\autocite{DDJF_OBDH}

The \ac{OBC} board contains the main \ac{OBC} logic, and is based around a \foothref{https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/SAMV71Q21RT}{Microchip SAMV71Q21RT} radiation-tolerant microcontroller and an \acs{MRAM} memory, used to store critical data. The board also hosts the in-house implemented components of the \ac{ADCS} subsystem, as a space-saving measure.

\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{SAMV71Q21RT}
	\caption{The \texttt{SAMV71Q21RT} microcontroller}
	\label{fig:samv71}
\end{marginfigure}

AcubeSAT's data interface is using a cold-redundant \ac{CAN} bus to facilitate cross-subsystem communication, selected due to its robustness and reliability \autocite{bouwmeester_survey_implementation_2017}. AcubeSAT boards implement the PC/104 mechanical interface \autocite{PC104}.

\subsection{\acf{OBSW}}

The \ac{OBSW} subsystem is responsible for the design and development of the nanosatellite's software. The language chosen to be used in the system's 4 \acp{MCU} is a reduced form of \textbf{C++}, and the code is guarded under a number of standards, static checkers and unit tests \autocite{DDJF_OBSW}. All software runs under the Free\acs{RTOS} operating system.



\subsection{\acf{OPS}}

The operations subsystem is responsible for the devising the operational modes \& procedures of the spacecraft, and ensuring the functionality, commandability and observability of the satellite before and during its mission.

During flight, AcubeSAT can remain within one of the following \textbf{system modes}:\autocite{MDO}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Launch/Off mode}: During this mode, the satellite is turned completely off, and no subsystems are energised. This is used to represent the state of the spacecraft inside the deployer, where no electronics are allowed to be energised,\autocite[req. 3.3.3]{CDS13} and the CubeSat is in a completely dormant state.
	
	\item \textbf{Commissioning mode}: This mode is initiated as soon as the CubeSat exits the deployer, meaning that launch is complete. It contains the initial startup actions of the spacecraft, including detumbling and antenna deployment. No science takes place during commissioning mode.
	
	\item \textbf{Nominal mode}: This mode represents the state where the CubeSat will spend most of the time on. Apart from the necessary autonomy functions and battery charging, the CubeSat will also downlink telemetry and science data. No science takes place during nominal mode, except for health checks commanded from the ground. Nominal mode is also the only mode where the satellite performs nadir or sun pointing (\Cref{sec:adcs}).
	
	\item \textbf{Science mode}: This is where the main experiment takes place and payload data are generated. This mode includes operation of the fluidic system, control of the microfluidic chip, reinvigoration of the cells, and periodic acquisition of pictures using the miniaturised microscope.
	
	AcubeSAT has split science mode into \textbf{3 distinct occurrences}, termed sub-experiments \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\), lasting 72 hours each, and taking place at different points of the mission to investigate the time-dependence of the observed results.
	
	\item \textbf{Safe mode}: It is common for spacecraft systems to include a \emph{safe mode},\autocite[385]{aguirre_introduction_space_2013} where the spacecraft switches off all non-essential systems and function, in order to respond to major malfunctions that cannot be corrected by autonomous procedures. Safe mode is intended as a well-defined and well-tested mode which is easy to maintain and reduces risk of any malfunction.
	
	On AcubeSAT, spacecraft functionality is significantly reduced, and the attitude profile includes pointing only. However, \ac{UHF} communication and beacon transmission are still active for observability purposes.
\end{itemize}

Each mode is associated with a \textbf{functional flow} diagram, showing a high-level description of the spacecraft operation during this mode \autocite{acubesatteam_acubesat_functional_2021}.

\subsection{Structural}

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{structure}
	\caption{The CubeSat's 3U \acs{COTS} structure}
	\label{fig:structure}
\end{marginfigure}


The Structural subsystem has taken over:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The analysis and configuration of the \ac{COTS} 3-unit structure (\Cref{fig:structure}) housing all the CubeSat's components. Vibration analyses are especially important, as they serve to investigate whether the CubeSat can withstand the launcher's loads.
	\item The complete design, manufacturing and assembly of the \textbf{payload container} and its unibody, hosting the scientific experiment of the mission (\Cref{fig:container}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\acf{SYE}}

The \acl{SYE} subteam serves as the technical authority for the satellite. It is responsible for coordinating the developments and interfaces between subsystems, ensuring the conformance to standards and technical requirements, and identifying \& resolving all issues arising from the complex multi-discipline design of the CubeSat.

Additionally, the \ac{SYE} team is responsible for some specific technical developments that do not belong in any of the other subsystems, such as \ac{RAMS}, \ac{FMEA}, harnessing and the \acl{MAIV} plan.

\subsection{\acf{SU}}
\begin{marginfigure}
	\includegraphics{chipFluor}
	\caption[Example mission image output]{Example mission image output \parencite{DDJF_PL}}
	\label{fig:chip_fluor}
\end{marginfigure}

The \acl{SU} subteam is responsible for the conceptualisation and implementation of the mission's scientific payload, namely the high-throughput study of the effects of \ac{LEO} environments on yeast cells.

The payload is composed of the following functional parts \autocite{DDJF_PL}:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item The \textbf{payload container}, an almost 2U aluminum structure, pressurised at standard atmospheric pressure, and designed to host all the payload instrumentation. The container also accomodates a unibody which mechanically supports all \ac{SU} components.
	\item A \textbf{microfluidic chip} based on \ac{PDMS}, hosting 384 chambers capable of probing 190 distinct strains of \emph{Saccharomyces Cerevisiae} for each subexperiment.
	\item A \textbf{fluidic system} composed from 2 pumps, 8 latching solenoid valves, 6 non-latching solenoid valves, and 3 fluid medium containers
	\item An \textbf{imaging system} operating as a microscope, containing a camera and a series of lights, filters and a lens
	\item A number of \textbf{heaters} to control component operational temperatures
	\item A number of redundant \textbf{sensors} for environmental measurements
	\item A \ac{PCB} containing the microcontroller and rest of the control components of the payload
\end{compactitem}

\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{Glass_Payload}
	\caption{Transparent view of the payload container and its internals}
	\label{fig:container}
\end{marginfigure}

There is a number of constraints that the payload imposes on \ac{FDIR} design:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Interruption} of one of the three 72-hour subexperiments during execution may mean complete loss of the subexperiment. The impact of such an event depends on the duration and timepoint of its occurence. In any case, adequate observability will allow the ground-control experiment to mimic the in-orbit conditions as much as possible.
	\item \textbf{Freezing} of liquids inside the chip and fluidic tubes may lead to permanent damage on the setup. As such, heater operation may be required even during safe mode, after the first sub-experiment has been performed and liquid has flown into the system. This characteristics imposes further restrictions on the minimum availability of the system, depending on the thermal conditions.
\end{enumerate}

	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Thermal}

The Thermal subteam is responsible for the thermal analysis of the satellite, where the solar and earth albedo conditions are combined with the components' heat dissipation to determine the worst-case temperatures experienced by the satellite in hot and cold conditions.

The results of thermal analysis typically lead to implementation of passive or active thermal control methods. Notably, in AcubeSAT, 3 electronically-controlled heaters are used for the batteries, \acs{PDMS} chip and valves.

\subsection{Trajectory}

The Trajectory subteam is responsible for the analysis of the spacecraft's orbit, the calculation of radiation effects, the satellite's compliance to space debris regulations, and the estimation of its orbital lifetime.

AcubeSAT's requirements do not dictate use of thrusters, meaning that the satellite's orbit will be determined solely by the launcher, and cannot be altered in flight. As the selected launcher opportunity is unknown until some time before satellite delivery, a number of sensitivity analyses are executed to determine the allowed orbits.

\begin{figure}

\section{Tools used}

As a complex project, AcubeSAT uses a set of supporting utilities, ready-made or built built by the team, to fulfil its technical and organisational needs. The following tools play a crucial role in the organisation:

\end{compactitem}

\chapter{The SAVOIR \ac{FDIR} concept}
\label{cap:savoir}

In this section, we will briefly examine the combination of two philosophies used by European organisations active in the space domain. The first philosophy is linked to the \textbf{\texttt{ECSS-E-ST-70-41C} standard} \autocite{ECSS-E-ST-70-41C} developed by the \acf{ECSS}, which defines the basic set of telemetry (\acs{TM}) and telecommands (\acs{TC}) that a satellite platform needs, so that it can be fully controllable by ground operators.

The second philosophy is based on the \textbf{\texttt{SAVOIR-HB-003} \acs{SAVOIR} \acs{FDIR} Handbook} \autocite{SAVOIR-HB-003} of the \textbf{\acf{SAVOIR}} initiative. This handbook is based on the functions of the aforementioned \texttt{ECSS-E-ST-70-41C} standard, and proposes a detailed methodology for the development of \ac{FDIR} in a space project. This handbook is \textbf{the basis of the philosophy} followed in the remainder of this thesis.

\section{The \acs{ECSS} \acl{PUS}}
\label{sec:pus}


The \texttt{ECSS-E-ST-70-41C} standard, or \textbf{\acs{PUS}} for short (\acl{PUS}), defines a set of structured \textbf{telecommands} and \textbf{telemetry} that a spacecraft can use to communicate with a \acl{GS}. It can be likened to a 'language' that lets operators be fully aware of a satellite's status and control all of its operational aspects. At the same time, it strictly specifies the basic functions that an autonomous system must perform, and defines the concepts of \textbf{applications}, \textbf{parameters} and \textbf{events}.

\begin{marginfigure}
	\includegraphics{ECSS-rq}
	\caption{The \ac{PUS} data transfer model}
	\label{fig:pusmodel}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{The \acs{ECSS} services}

This standard is intended for use in any space mission, complementing other standards for mission-specific operations, communications or file transfer. Its authors recommend \acs{PUS} users to tailor it to their needs, viewing it as a ``menu'' from where the applicable parts are selected for each specific mission. In summary, the following 20 distinct ``services'' are provided in the standard \autocite{ECSS-E-ST-70-41C,ECSS-E-70-41A,kaufeler_esa_standard_1994}:

\marginnote{%
	\textbf{Application Process}: Any physical (hardware) or logical (software) entity that can receive telecommands and generate telemetry in terms of the \acs{PUS}
	
	\textbf{Event}: Occurence of a set of conditions that can arise during the mission, such as:
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Autonomous actions taken
		\item Detected fault or anomaly
		\item Predefined steps of a process
	\end{compactitem}
	
	\textbf{Parameter}: Readable and modifiable data container that can represent:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Basic system or component settings
		\item Sensor measurements and other telemetry values
		\item \acs{FDIR} results and diagnostics
	\end{itemize}
}


\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[01]}: Request verification}
	
	Provides acknowledgement or failure reports for executed commands. This service essentially informs the operators about the status of \ac{TC} sent to the spacecraft, and reports any occurred errors during parsing or execution.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[02]}: Device access}
	
	Allows toggling, controlling and reconfiguring any on-board peripherals that do not support the \ac{PUS} paradigm, but rely on simpler protocols to communicate.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[03]}: Housekeeping}
	
	Produces periodic reports containing values of on-board parameters. This service essentially composes the periodic \acs{RF} \textbf{beacon} of the satellite, by storing and transmitting parameter values without any prior \acs{TC} request.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[04]}: Parameter statistics reporting}
	
	Allows reporting statistics (min, max, mean, standard deviation) for specific parameters over specified intervals. This is a memory-efficient alternative to the \texttt{ST[03]} housekeeping service.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[05]}: Event reporting}
	
	Generates reports when notable occurrences take place on-board, such as:
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Autonomous on-board actions
		\item Detected failures or anomalies
		\item Predefined steps during an operation
	\end{compactitem}
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[06]}: Memory management}
	
	Allows writing and reading directly from an on-board memory unit. This can be useful for debugging and investigative purposes, fetching mission data, or uploading new software to the spacecraft avionics. The service also provides for downlinking and uplinking files in a file system.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[07]}: Task management} \emph{(deprecated)}
	
	Allows stopping, suspending or resuming software tasks in case of contingency. This service has been removed from the standard and is only mentioned as a reference.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[08]}: Function management}
	
	Provides the capability of running predefined actions that can receive further parameters. These actions can correspond to payload, platform, or any other functionality.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[09]}: Time management}
	
	Allows periodic reporting of the current absolute spacecraft time for observability and correlation purposes.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[10]}: Time packet} \emph{(deprecated)}
	
	Used in the past for time packet generation. This service has been removed from the standard and is only mentioned as a reference.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[11]}: Time-based scheduling}
	
	Allows the operators to \textbf{"time-tag"} telecommands for execution at future timestamps, instead of immediately.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[12]}: On-board monitoring}
	
	This service allows checking parameter values to ensure that they remain within configurable limits. Whenever a violation occurs, an \texttt{ST[05]} can be optionally generated for further processing.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[13]}: Large packet transfer}
	
	Provides a method of message segmentation, for message payloads that are too large to fit within the maximum allowed length for \ac{TC} or \ac{TM}.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[14]}: Real-time forwarding control}
	
	This service is responsible of controlling which types of generated reports are immediately transmitted to the \acl{GS}.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[15]}: On-board storage and retrieval}
	
	This service allows storing generated report on-board, as well as their commanded mass retrieval when the spacecraft has \acl{GS} visibility.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[16]}: On-board traffic management} \emph{(deprecated)}
	
	Allows monitoring the status and load of an on-board data bus and provides commands for resolution of errors. This service has been removed from the standard and is only mentioned as a reference.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[17]}: Test}
	
	This service allows performing on-board connection and "are-you-alive" checks.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[18]}: On-board operations procedure}
	
	Allows loading, controlling (start, suspend, resume, abort) and configuring On-Board Control Procedures, which are sequences of commands written in an application-specific language.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[19]}: Event-action}
	
	Provides the operators with the capability of autonomously executing \acp{TC} when an \texttt{ST[05]} event is triggered.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[20]}: On-board parameter management}
	
	Provides the capability of reading and setting on-board parameters. Parameters are some of the most important entities defined in the \acs{PUS}, and can represent:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Read-write configuration variables for the system or lower-level components
		\item Read-only sensor and other telemetry values
		\item \ac{FDIR} results and diagnostics
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[21]}: Request sequencing}
	
	Allows operators to load series of \acp{TC} to be executed in a sequential order.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[22]}: Position-based scheduling}
	
	Provides the capability of executing \acp{TC} when the spacecraft reaches a specific point in its orbit.
	
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ST[23]}: File management}
	
	Provides the capability of managing on-board file systems, with functions such as \emph{copy}, \emph{move}, \emph{delete}, or \emph{create directory}.
\end{compactitem}

\section{The SAVOIR standard}

\begin{figure*}[h]
	\includegraphics{FDIRpus-en}
	\caption{\acs{FDIR} data flow in the \acs{ECSS} services}
\end{figure*}

The \texttt{SAVOIR-HB-003} handbook describes in detail the processes and \acs{FDIR} methodology, based on results \& lessons learned from previous space missions. In this chapter, we will provide brief commentary on the parts concerning a low-cost CubeSat mission.

\subsection{\acs{FDIR} process steps}

The steps of the \acs{FDIR} process are defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
	\item \textbf{Requirement specification}: Here, based on the needs of each mission, we analyse the requirements of the system for reliability \& availability, and extract the relevant technical \acs{FDIR} requirements, in functional and performance terms. In this stage, no solutions or design decisions are taken, but we define the problems that must be solved and the relevant success criteria.
	\label{itm:fdir_reqs}

	
	Although the formulation of technical specifications for random events and failures is difficult, especially if there is a lack of reliability data, the handbook suggests a set of technical specifications \autocite[42]{SAVOIR-HB-003} that can be used by missions. A large set of these specifications are also met by the design presented in the following sections.
	
	\item \textbf{Concept definition}: This stage involves the comparison of the general \acs{FDIR} strategies that can solve the requirements of \cref{itm:fdir_reqs}. Solutions such as redundancy, cross-strapping, triple-redundant voting or inherently reliable (high-cost) components.
	
	
	\label{itm:fdir_concept}

	\item \textbf{Architecture}: This step defines the \acs{FDIR} design on a general level based on the system's capabilities, without implementation details, but with enough information for the system structure and the interfaces between elements.
	
	\item \textbf{Detailed design}: Before completing the full design of the \acs{FDIR}, we have to prepare the \textbf{\acf{FMEA}} \autocite{carlson_effective_fmeas_2012} for the system and its subsystems. The \acs{FMEA} is the \textbf{list of all possible failure modes} for satellite elements, where the severity and compensating provisions of each are listed in a standard way.
	
	\label{itm:fdir_cdr}
	
	
	Then, for every feared event of the \acs{FMEA} catalogue, we perform the \textbf{\acf{HSIA}} \autocite{ECSS-Q-ST-30-02C}. In essence, this is where the \textbf{observed data} and \textbf{recovery \& isolation actions} are listed for each failure.
	
	Apart from the aforementioned, the exact operating method and flow of the \acs{FDIR} is detailed for every satellite mode, with special attention given to \emph{Safe Mode} (\Cref{itm:safe_mode}).
	
	\item \textbf{Implementation \& Verificaton}: At this stage, the \acs{FDIR} hardware and software are constructed, ready to detect and respond to satellite failures. Additionally, for every item in the \acs{HSIA}, \textbf{verification} is performed by analysis or testing. In particular, each feared event must be simulated, and the correct handling of it by the system must by ensured.
	\label{itm:fdir_valid}
	
	\item \textbf{Validation}: In this stage we perform \textbf{system-level} tests of the \acs{FDIR} after assembly \& integration of the entire spacecraft, as part of the test campaign.\footnote{May contain functional system tests (ambient tests) or environmental tests}
	
	\item \textbf{In-operations preparation}: In the last step, final changes are made to the literature \& documentation to enhance the remote operability of the mission.
\end{enumerate}

Although all the above steps have high significance, "lean" missions need to especially focus on requirements (\Cref{itm:fdir_reqs}), concept definition (\Cref{itm:fdir_concept}), detailed design (\Cref{itm:fdir_cdr}) and verification (\Cref{itm:fdir_valid}). A simple example of an application of this process can be found in \Cref{cap:practical}.

At this point, it should be made clear that the \acs{FDIR} design process and the system reliability analysis in general should be taken into account \textbf{throughout the lifetime} of a space project, and not only after the rest of the platform has been designed or implemented. The \ac{RAMS} domain is directly linked to all other subsystems, receiving the required inputs but also heavily influencing the rest of the design. In particular, young CubeSat projects tend to not pay the necessary attention to the reliability domain \autocite{langer_reliability_estimation_2017}.

\subsection{Proposed architecture}

The handbook proposes some principles for the architectural design of an \acs{FDIR} system, the first of which considers it as a \textbf{hierarchical} system, where minor failures are caused and corrected at component level, or are propagated as major failures to the rest of the system and require more impactful recovery actions.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{FDIR-levels-en}
	\caption[Suggested FDIR levels hierarchy]{Suggested FDIR levels hierarchy. Each mission can choose a different set of levels to simplify or refine the implementation.}
	\label{fig:FDIR-levels}
\end{figure}

Moving on, a \textbf{configurable} implementation is proposed that takes advantage of the spacecraft's \textbf{database} in order to store the detection and recovery events. The database and communication tools from the \textbf{\acs{PUS} services} of \Cref{sec:pus} are utilised to fully meet these requirements. This logic entails the following:
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Reliability-related data are stored in \textbf{parameters} (e.g. sensor values, peripheral status
	\item These parameters are \textbf{monitored} by the \emph{on-board monitoring} service. When a parameter gets out of bounds, a failure event is assumed.
	\item Each out-of-bounds parameter creates an \textbf{event} that is telemetered to the ground segment.
	\item Each event is associated with an \textbf{action}, stored in the \emph{event-action} service.
	\item This action may contain one or more procedures to correct the failure.
\end{compactenum}

\begin{figure*}[h]
	\includegraphics{FDIRpus-en}
	\caption{Data flow for failure detection}
	\label{fig:fdirpus}
\end{figure*}

The above logic is summarized in \Cref{fig:fdirpus}. Its importance lies in that it provides a \textbf{structured} way for the system to handle any of the predicted problems, but at the same time enables developers and operators to:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Obtain all information on the operational status of components and sensor values.
	\item Safely interfere entirely with the operation of the \acs{FDIR} without changing the source code.
	\item Partially or completely disable \acs{FDIR} if necessary for diagnostic purposes.
	\item Use a ready and tested \acs{ECSS} services software suite to implement all of the above, reducing cost and development time.
	\item Avoid unconfigurable "hard-coding" of \acs{FDIR} procedures at various points in the code.
\end{compactitem}

\chapter{Practical demonstration of \ac{FDIR}}

As a proof of concept for AcubeSAT's \ac{FDIR} implementation, a practical setup to simulate the satellite's behaviour was prepared (\Cref{fig:block}). Key elements of the setup are:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item A Cortex-M7 \textbf{microcontroller}, used to simulate a \textbf{satellite subsystem}
	\item A number of redundant \textbf{sensors} used as the potential failure points
	\item The accompanying \textbf{software} that includes an implementation of the \ac{ECSS} services and the \ac{SAVOIR} \ac{FDIR} methodology
	\item A desktop computer, serving as the \textbf{ground station} to provide the necessary commanding and observing capabilities
\end{compactitem}

\section{System Description}

\subsection{Functionality}
\label{sec:tsvcd}

In order to emulate the most core functions of a spacecraft subsystem, we implemented a system with a single functional requirement:
\begin{quote}
	\texttt{RQ-010}: The system shall measure and report the ambient temperature.
\end{quote}

In order to justify implementing an \ac{FDIR} approach for this system, we will introduce a reliability requirement:
\begin{quote}
	\texttt{RQ-020}: No single failure on any measuring component shall lead to loss of system functionality
\end{quote}

The detailed design of this simple demonstration system is presented in the following sections, and was architected to match the functionality, interfaces, design and software of the AcubeSAT nanosatellite as much as possible.

\subsection{Hardware}

The centre of the demonstration system is the \ac{MCU} used to simulate the design and functionality of one of AcubeSAT's subsystems (\Cref{sec:obdh}). The selected \ac{MCU} is the Atmel \texttt{ATSAMV71Q21} hosted on the \foothref{https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATSAMV71-XULT}{\texttt{ATSAMV71-XULT}} development board. This \ac{MCU} is functionally identical to the one that will be used in orbit, featuring a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M7 core with \SI{2}{\mebi\byte} of flash and \SI{384}{\kibi\byte} of \acs{SRAM} memory, and a maximum clock speed of \SI{300}{\mega\hertz}.

The \ac{MCU} is accompanied by two \textbf{temperature sensors} which are used to simulate subsystem components which are prone to failure. The selected sensor is the Microchip \foothref{https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCP9808}{\texttt{MCP9808}} which offers an accurate and frequent temperature readout over an \ac{I2C} bus. The maximum acquisition interval for the sensor is \SI{250}{\milli\second}.

\marginnote{%
\textbf{Cold redundancy:} Only one component is operating, while the other is not.

\textbf{Warm redundancy:} One component is operating fully, and the other is operating with reduced functionality.

\textbf{Hot redundancy:} Two or more simultaneously active parts operate in parallel. \parencite{SAVOIR-HB-003}
}

The two sensors are wired in a \textbf{hot-redundant} configuration, due to their extremely low operating power. The two sensors are connected to different \ac{I2C} buses, so that the failure of one bus will not affect the operation of the other sensor.

\paragraph{\acs{USB} interface} In order to receive \acl{TM} and transmit \acl{TC} to the demonstrative space segment, a \acs{USB} link with a desktop computer is integrated into the design. This link uses the \acs{UART} peripheral of the microcontroller, which solely transfers \acs{ECSS} messages between the microcontroller and the desktop. These messages include the typical \acs{TM} reports and \acs{TC} requests, but also log messages intended for diagnostic purposes.

As the \acs{UART} protocol does not offer packetisation facilities by default, \ac{COBS} encoding \autocite{cheshire_consistent_overhead_1997} is implemented for all transmitted messages.

\begin{figure*}[h]
	\includegraphics{ElectricalSchematic}
	\caption[Simplified electrical schematic of the implementation]{Simplified electrical schematic of the implementation. The two sensors are wired via \ac{I2C} with the necessary pull-up resistors. Their power is controlled directly by microcontroller outputs, allowing the user to completely cut the power of the sensors if needed. The \texttt{A} pins of the sensors are arbitrarily set to select the \ac{I2C} address of each device. The same address was used, as the two \ac{I2C} buses are separate. Decoupling capacitors, crystals and other boilerplate components are not shown, as they are already included in the \ac{MCU} development board.}
	\label{fig:schematic}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Connections}
The development board and sensors were laid out and connected directly. The sensor \acp{IC} were soldered on breakout \acp{PCB} which were manufactured based on Jaroslav Sýkora's design.\url{https://www.jsykora.info/2019/06/pcb-panel-\-of-smt-breakout-boards-soic-tssop-msop/}

\section{Software}

\subsection{Flight Segment}

All \ac{FDIR} operations and functionality are developed using the \textbf{C++} language\footnote{The \texttt{C++17} standard has been selected} on the \ac{MCU}. All developments rely on free and open source software which is freely available for download and modification. The \foothref{https://git-scm.com/}{Git} version control is used for all software projects.

The \ac{FDIR} functionality is structured around the \textbf{ECSS-E-ST-70-41C \ac{PUS} implementation created by the AcubeSAT team}\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.com/acubesat/obc/ecss-services}}, which offers a modular implementation of the standard utilising modern C++.

The \ac{MCU} software and business logic are built on \textbf{\foothref{https://www.freertos.org/}{Free\acs{RTOS}}}, a low-footprint real-time operating system targeted towards embedded devices. FreeRTOS provides the capability of safe concurrency, along with support for well-controlled tasks and a number of synchronisation primitives.

\begin{figure*}[h]
	\includegraphics{SoftwareFlow}
	\caption{View of the software components and the data flow between them}
	\label{sec:softwareflow}
\end{figure*}

To ensure high reliability and a low resource footprint of the software, the following \textbf{constraints} are enacted in C++ development:
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Dynamic memory allocation\footnote{Use of \texttt{malloc}, \texttt{new} etc.} is banned completely from the code.
	\label{itm:malloc}
	\item \Cref{itm:malloc} means that standard C++ containers cannot be used. Instead, the \foothref{https://www.etlcpp.com/}{\acf{ETL}} is integrated in the software.
	\item "Expensive" features such as Run-Time Type Inference, Dynamic Casts or exceptions are also prohibited.
\end{compactenum}

The \foothref{https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/embedded-software-center/mplab-harmony-v3}{MPLAB Harmony} \ac{HAL} and configurator are used to interface with all the \acs{MCU}'s peripherals. \foothref{https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/}{CLion} has been selected as the \acs{IDE}, along with the \foothref{https://cmake.org/}{CMake} build system.

All software developed in the scope of this thesis is available online, and listed in \Cref{tab:new_software}. The most critical parts of the developed software are expanded in \Cref{sec:source_code}. A summary of used libraries can also be found in \Cref{tab:old_software}.

\subsection{\ac{I2C} Failure Detection}

It is of interest to investigate how the hardware \ac{I2C} peripheral provided by the microcontroller can be used to monitor the symptoms of bus failure.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Microcontroller peripheral errors}
	
	\marginnote{To ensure detection of peripheral errors, it is important to make sure that the error status of the peripheral is not discarded after every operation. Interrupts and the \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes/nodiscard}{\mintinline{cpp}{[[nodiscard]]}} C++ feature are used to ensure that all errors are caught.}
	The microcontroller's \ac{I2C} peripheral is capable of generating an error whenever \emph{the communicating peripheral does not set the "acknowledge" bit}. Failure to set this bit might be a result of disconnection of the clock or data lines, failure of the bus, or non-operation of the peripheral itself.
	
	\item \textbf{Response timeout}
	
	For some adverse \ac{I2C} bus conditions, such as incorrectly chosen pull-up resistor values or large amounts of capacitive load, \ac{I2C} signal integrity may be lost (\Cref{subfig:i2c_clean}). This error is not detected by the microcontroller's peripheral directly, but can be diagnosed by adding a timeout to the sensor's data readouts.
	
	\item \textbf{Chip ID}
	
	\begin{margintable}
		\centering
		\caption{Read-only registers for the MCP9808}
		\label{tab:mcp9808readonly}
		\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}lXl@{}}
			\toprule
			Address & Register Name & Value \\ \midrule
			\texttt{0x06} & Manufacturer ID & \texttt{0x0054} \\
			\texttt{0x07} & Device ID & \texttt{0x0400} \\ \bottomrule
		\end{tabularx}
	\end{margintable}
	
	It is possible that the sensor suffers a severe fault but is still able to respond to \ac{I2C} commands or set the \emph{acknowledge} bit. For this reason, a more rigid check of the sensor's status is performed before each temperature read: the \emph{permanently-set} registers of the peripheral contain values which, under nominal conditions, are hard-coded and will not change, barring hardware failure. If any value other than the expected one is return, the peripheral or the bus are assumed to have a fault.

\subsection{Mission Control}

The ground segment desktop computer needs to parse received packets and send commands, as well as display information about the sensor measurements, \ac{FDIR} status and health of the connected flight system.

The \acs{YAMCS} \autocite{sela_yamcs_lightweight_2012} framework was selected to cover the aforementioned needs, and has been tailored to provide the capabilities needed for this demonstration.

The \ac{ECSS} protocol\autocite{ECSS-E-ST-70-41C} is not supported by \acs{YAMCS} by default. However, the necessary commands have been integrated into the system using the supported \ac{XTCE} specification.\autocite{simon_xtce_standard_2004} The source code of the integration can be found in \Cref{app:xtce}.

\section{\ac{FDIR} setup}

The purpose of the test setup is to observe the response of the system to any failure of the two "vulnerable" temperature sensors. For this purpose, we will attempt to simulate every failure mode of each sensor, and design an \ac{FDIR} implementation that anticipates all those failures.

\marginnote{Double failures are not investigated in the scope of this document, as they are mostly considered only for launchers and manned missions \parencite{SAVOIR-HB-003}.}
As a required input for the \ac{FDIR} detailed design, a \ac{FMEA} analysis needs to be prepared for the system. All \ac{FMEA} performed follows the requirements of the ECSS-Q-ST-30-02C standard.\autocite{ECSS-Q-ST-30-02C} The analysis is based on the \ac{FMEA} performed for the AcubeSAT nanosatellite,\autocite{retselis_acubesat_fmea_2020} and can be seen in \Cref{tab:fmea} for the reduced system. All expected failure modes for the two sensors are investigated, as well as a failure mode for the entire system that can be detected by correctly-operating sensors. Each of those failure modes will be later verified by injecting software or hardware modifications.

\subsection{\ac{FDIR} detailed design}

\begin{figure*}[ht]
	\includegraphics{TempSensorFDIR}
	\caption[Overview of the temperature sensor FDIR process]{Overview of the temperature sensor \ac{FDIR} process. For every process executed and failure detected, corresponding telemetry is generated as well.}
	\label{fig:fdirtemp}
\end{figure*}

The \ac{FDIR} of the sensors follows the hierarchical process described in \Cref{sec:fdir_operating_modes}, which is shown in \Cref{fig:fdirtemp} as tailored for the sensors.

The approach acts using the following steps, which are constantly being executed in the background:
\marginnote{For this demonstration, we will not investigate failures of the microcontroller itself and its internals. Refer to \parencite{retselis_acubesat_fmea_2020} for AcubeSAT's \acs{FMEA} and \acs{HSIA} on the microcontrollers.}
\begin{compactenum}
	\item The \ac{I2C} bus health status is monitored. Any failure or lack of communication indicates a failure in the sensor's electronics.
	\item The temperature output of the sensors is monitored. Any values which are outside the bounds of the physically possible thermal conditions are considered to indicate sensor or communication failures. Any values outside the operational limits of the subsystem's electronics are considered to indicate overheating and lead to a subsystem restart.
	\item In order to recover from the failures, first a restart of the sensor is attempted. If the erroneous values still persist, then the sensor cannot recover from the failure, but is just isolated and disabled instead.
\end{compactenum}

\clearpage
\paragraph{\acl{HSIA}}

After defining the possible failure modes and logic of the system, we are ready to analyse each entry to provide the correct software inputs to implement the required \ac{FDIR}. More specifically, for each failure, the following must be defined: \autocite[84]{SAVOIR-HB-003}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Parameters to be monitored for detection
	\item Value ranges to be used to warn that a parameter is exceeding a specified range
	\item Isolation and reconfiguration actions to prevent failure propagation and, if possible, bring the system to a well operating state
\end{compactitem}

The above information is listed in the \acf{HSIA} table, which links each failure (identified in the \acl{FMEA}) to the corresponding low-level software parameters (\Cref{tab:hsia}).

For the purposes of this demonstration, we will consider that all \ac{FMEA} items can lead to \emph{feared events}, i.e. that \ac{FDIR} will anticipate all identified possible failures.

The \ac{HSIA} adds the following significant pieces of information to the \ac{FMEA}:\autocite{ECSS-Q-ST-30-02C}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{monitored parameters} and the \textbf{conditions} that trigger the recovery action.
	
	These are listed here in terms of \ac{PUS} parameters which can be easily identified and compared by software. This list is then linked to the corresponding \emph{\texttt{ST[12]} on-board monitoring} service definitions, listed in \Cref{tab:demo_monitoring}.
	
	It is important to note that no single out-of-bounds value can trigger a recovery action. This is recommended in order to prevent transient errors or temporary communication protocol issues from triggering an unnecessary response which might disable a well-functioning component.
	
	\marginnote{\textbf{Temporary failure}: Caused by events such as bit flips, noise or transients, and can be corrected without intervention, or with a simple restart/power-cycle.\par\textbf{Permament failure}: A failure (typically in hardware, e.g. due to latchups or short-circuits) that cannot be corrected autonomously.}
	The distinction between \emph{temporary} and \emph{permanent} failures is made by \textbf{counting the number of consecutive failures}. Before a permanent action to disable a sensor is enacted, at least 5 attempts to communicate must have failed.
	
	The use of 2 hot-redundant sensor also allows us to investigate the difference between the two temperatures to deduce the health of the produced data. If the absolute difference between the 2 values is too high, assuming the sensors are placed close enough together, an error condition is assumed. However, as triple modular redundancy was not implemented for this system, it is not possible to deduce which sensor has failed.
	
	\item The \textbf{failure recovery and isolation actions}.
	
	These are listed in terms of \ac{PUS} events (\emph{\texttt{ST[05]} event reporting}) and event-actions (\emph{\texttt{ST[19]} eventaction}), which are linked to \Cref{tab:demo_eventaction}.
	
	The selected recovery actions match the approach shown in \Cref{fig:fdirtemp}. Additionally, when it is not known which sensor has failed, a fail-safe approach of restarting or disabling both sensors is used.

\paragraph{Parameters}

After investigating the \acl{HSIA}, we can list the scalar parameters for the \emph{\texttt{ST[20]} parameter management} service\autocite{ECSS-E-ST-70-41C} (\Cref{tab:demo_params}).

Beyond the actual temperature values, we have included the \textbf{difference} (\(\Delta\)) between the two temperatures, since the \acs{PUS} standard does not provide ways to perform arithmetic calculations without hard-coded software. Additionally, the status of each sensor peripheral is included, which is an enumerated value.\footnote{One of \texttt{NOMINAL}, \texttt{TIMEOUT} or \texttt{DISABLED}} 

These parameters are telemetered to the ground segment and displayed to the user periodically, via the \emph{\texttt{ST[03]} housekeeping} \ac{PUS} service. However, during flight, the ground segment will not have constant access, since the satellite will not be visible from ground stations throughout its entire orbit.

\paragraph{On-board monitoring definitions}

After defining the parameters, the monitoring definitions that establish the acceptable and actionable ranges for each parameter should be outlined. These are then managed by the \emph{\texttt{ST[12]} on-board monitoring} \ac{PUS} service.

The \emph{check validity conditions} are important to mention in this case, as they use the three \emph{Status} parameters to prevent executing checks for disabled peripherals. As such, sensors that are not providing values due to hardware issues, \ac{FDIR} actions or operator intervention, will not be able to trigger \ac{FDIR} actions.

\end{table*}

\paragraph{Event-action definitions}

The final part of the puzzle are the event-action definitions, which can be seen on \Cref{tab:demo_eventaction} and combine:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \ac{PUS} events (\texttt{ST[05]} service) which are automatically generated when an on-board monitoring definition goes out of limits
	\item \ac{PUS} event-action definitions (\texttt{ST[19]} service), which link every occurrence of an event to a stored \ac{TC} that is immediately executed.
	They define the \acs{FDIR} recovery actions.
\end{itemize}

All the aforementioned definitions can be easily modified by operators using single commands that affect the on-board stored \ac{PUS} database.

\section{\ac{FDIR} validation}

\subsection{Nominal operation}

During nominal operation, no failures are simulated. The system is connected to power and outputs \ac{ECSS} telemetry (\Cref{fig:yamcshousekeeping}), which includes parameter values parsed by (\Cref{fig:yamcsparameter}). Additionally, a log file is kept for diagnostic purposes (\Cref{fig:lognominal}). The system is compliant with its requirements (\Cref{sec:tsvcd}) and can transmit the temperature to the ground station as expected.

\label{fig:lognominal}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation of failures}

The following methods were used to simulate each failure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For component communication failures, each sensor was just physically disconnected from the system.
	\item For small changes in temperature, a hot air gun or other hot air source was pointed towards each sensor. Care was taken to not exceed the rated temperatures of the affected components.
	\item For changes in temperature which were impractical to simulate, the failure was injected in software, by manually modifying the variable.
	
	The two buttons present on the development board were used as a simple interface to "inject" extreme temperature values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Real-time modification of \ac{FDIR}}

The power of \acs{SAVOIR}'s \ac{FDIR} approach lies in the fact that the entire \ac{FDIR} concept can be safely modified via \ac{TC} without requiring any modifications or reuploads of the spacecraft's software. The application of the \acs{ECSS} services paradigm allows customising all on-board \ac{FDIR} functions and associated services using predefined \ac{TC} structures. In this section, \acs{ECSS} commands will be executed to demonstrate these capabilities and their control from the Ground Station.

The level of reconfigurability possible is defined by requirements listed in \parencite{ECSS-E-ST-70-11C,SAVOIR-HB-003}. The tailored version used for our experiments is listed in \Cref{tab:fdir-recon-rq}.

	\end{tabularx}
\end{table*}

The \ac{YAMCS} platform was once again used to generate the wanted commands (\Cref{fig:yamcs_commands}).
